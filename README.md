# Dog Viewer

Hi there! :) Thank you for checking out my Dog Viewer assignment. I adhered to the time-limit of the assignment and focused on part #1 of it, especially if I wanted to make the code look nice and clean. With that in mind, I focused on the functionality on the app and kept the styling at a minimum (other than what was required, of course); though I did come back a few hours later to quickly implement this README file and a couple of unit tests.

So, you have two options to interact with the app depending on what you want to do!

## Option #1: Clone the repository

From your terminal/console, navigate to the folder where you want this repository to live, and go ahead and clone it:

```git clone https://github.com/anaegm/dog-viewer.git```

When the command finishes running, navigate to the new directory where this project now lives:

```cd dog-viewer```

And install all necessary packages:

```npm install```

Run the project, and see it live on your localhost!

```npm run dev```

The address should be: http://localhost:5173/

## Option #2: See the app 

If you just want to take a quick peek at the app itself without bothering with the code, you can see it in this link too!

Happy holidays :)
